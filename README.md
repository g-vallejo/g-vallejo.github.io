I'm a PhD candidate at [UniMelb](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing), very fortunate to be advised by [Lea Frermann](https://www.frermann.de/) and [Tim Baldwin](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/index.html). My thesis focuses on exploring ways of automatically find biases in news articles. I consider myself a computational linguist, who likes to dance, read and discuss about general things. I love the idea of combining languages and computer science, therefore nlp is one of my passions.

### Work experience
My (current) main interest is fairness in news data. But I like to keep an eye in many other topics like: automatic fact checking (afc), question answering, generation. Dialogue systems will be probably my first love for ever. 

Before my PhD, I worked as a researcher at UKP at the TU Darmstadt. Previously, I was a machine learning consultant at Novatec GmbH, a company with headquarters in Leinfelden Germany. There, I worked on prototyping solutions for different clients and helping with the design of workshops and lectures about machine learning. Previous to that I interned for several companies, including Mercedes Benz in Germany and in CA, USA, Sony Deutschland GmbH and Compart AG in Boeblingen Germany. For more details see my cv [here](CV_042020.pdf).
