# Biographie
I'm a computational linguist, who likes to explore around with deep learning. I love the idea of combining languages and computer science, therefore nlp is one of my passions.

### Work experience
Currently, I'm working as a research associate for the UKP Lab at TU Darmstadt. 

Before UKP, I worked for Novatec GmbH, a consultant company with headquarters in Leinfelden Germany. There, I was a machine learning consultant, prototyping solutions for different clients and helping with the design of workshops and lectures about machine learning. Previous to that I interned for several companies, including Mercedes Benz in Germany and in CA, USA, Sony Deutschland GmbH and Compart AG.
